# Customer Credit Data Analysis and Hypothetical Credit Scoring

## Project Overview

This project involves a thorough **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and the development of a **hypothetical credit scoring system** using a comprehensive dataset of customer details and credit-related information. The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns, identify potential risks, and guide strategies for credit risk mitigation by building insightful features and models.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Understand the data structure, distributions, and relationships.
   - Handle missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Use visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices) to identify trends.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new informative features (5-10) based on domain knowledge and EDA findings.
   - Aggregate customer-level features for better analysis.
   - Ensure the new features contribute meaningfully to creditworthiness evaluation.

3. **Hypothetical Credit Score Calculation:**
   - Develop a scoring methodology inspired by credit industry standards (e.g., FICO).
   - Assign appropriate weightage to each feature.
   - Calculate and assign credit scores to each customer.

4. **Insights and Analysis:**
   - Analyze factors influencing creditworthiness and risk.
   - Implement time-based metrics (e.g., last 3-6 months) for dynamic credit scoring.
   - Provide actionable insights and potential strategies for risk mitigation.

### Project Structure:
- **`/data`**: Raw and processed datasets used for analysis.
- **`/notebooks`**: Jupyter notebooks with detailed EDA, feature engineering, and credit score calculations.
- **`/src`**: Python scripts for feature engineering, credit scoring, and visualization.
- **`/reports`**: Final analysis and key insights derived from the project.


### Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Colab Notebook
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
