# *CREDIT SCORE CALCULATION WITH EDA*
## Problem statement:
To conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and deep analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing basic customer details and extensive credit-related information. 
The aim is to create new, informative features, calculate a hypothetical credit score, and uncover meaningful patterns, anomalies, and insights within the data.

## Credit Score:
● A numerical representation of creditworthiness, reflecting credit history and financial behavior.<br> ● It's used by lenders, landlords, and others to assess the risk of lending money or extending credit to an individual.<br>    
## Credit Types:
### Secured Credit:
Backed by collateral, such as a house or car. If the borrower 
fails to repay, the lender can seize the collateral to cover the debt. 
### Unsecured Credit: 
Not tied to collateral; approval is based on creditworthiness. Credit cards and personal loans are typical unsecured credit.
### Revolving Credit:
Allows borrowing up to a credit limit, with flexible repayments. Credit cards are a common example of revolving credit, where borrowers can make purchases and pay off balances over time.
### Revolving vs. Non-Revolving Credit:
Credit can be categorized as either revolving (e.g., credit cards) or non-revolving (e.g., installment loans). Revolving credit allows for ongoing borrowing within a credit limit, while non-revolving credit involves a fixed loan amount withscheduled repayments.
### Installment Credit: 
Involves fixed payments over a specified term, like auto loans or mortgages.
### Lines of Credit:
A line of credit is a flexible credit arrangement where a lender establishes a maximum borrowing limit for the borrower. Borrowers can access funds as needed and only pay interest on the amount they use.
